## Contributing...
The best way to contribute is to complain. To complain refers to informing me of a bug or suggesting a new feature to be included to the software. Pls refer to the "Contact me" section below.

If I perceive your suggested feature to be beyond the scope of the software, I will not approve it. However, you can still download the code and build your own feature. As long as you keep the .sg in your project name, I am ok with it.
